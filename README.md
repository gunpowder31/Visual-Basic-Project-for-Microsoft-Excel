# Visual-Basic-Project-for-Microsoft-Excel
The following project is a Macro-enabled Excel file. It uses visual basic codes to create payslips and Salary slips from a payroll sheet and then sends the slips to the employees email (column in payroll). The Payslip and Salary Slips sheets are created as PDFs in a folder where the excel file is located.
